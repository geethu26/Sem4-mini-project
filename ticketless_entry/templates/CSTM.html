        <h3>ABOUT</h3><br>
        <p style="font-size: 24px;"> Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (CST) is one of the few UNESCO World Heritage Sites that is a working railway station, handling some of the busiest rail traffic and the most massive crowds in the world! While running through the station at rush hour, it is easy to miss the amazing architecture which makes it a world heritage site, which is why a section of the main building has been opened to the public as a Heritage Gallery.</p>
        <br>
        <p style="font-size: 24px;">The main section of CST Heritage Gallery is all about the history of Indian railways, and especially, Great Indian Peninsular Railway or GIPR. The Victoria Terminus was built as the headquarters of GIPR, and all over the building, you can see the four letters intertwined in the unmistakable logo of the precursor of Indian Railways.</p>
        <br>
        <p style="font-size: 24px;">The museum section has miniature models of the building as well as trains and engines as they evolved from steam to diesel and finally, electric. There are old photos as well as advertisements, tickets and flyers, all telling the story of the development of the railways and the city itself.</p>
        <br>
        <p style="font-size: 24px;">Heritage Tour takes you through the winding staircase with a view of the impressive dome from the inside. The gorgeous stained glass reflecting the light falling on the ancient stone is an impressive sight, as are the intricate carvings on the pillars depicting a variety of animals. The elaborately carved peacock on the first-floor window is something that cannot be missed! On the outside, the faces of the founders are a constant reminder of the forethought and perseverance which gave rise to Indian railways, and it is awe-inspiring to think of the effort which went into making this the world heritage site that it is today!</p>
